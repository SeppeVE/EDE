# Taxi Project

This is the documentation of the project for Enterprise Development Experience.
The idea behind my project is a fictional taxi company in which customers, taxis and trips will be managed in three different microservices.  

Here is a little more information about the microservices, but they will be explained in more detail when their functions are shown.
* Customer-Service: Manage all the information regarding customers.
* Taxi-Service: Manage all information regarding the taxis (cars) that the company has.
* Trip-Service: Combine customer and taxi values to create a trip alongside extra trip information.
* API-Gateway: A service used to brigde between user and the program, allows easy access to a single main url.
